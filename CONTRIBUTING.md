# Contributing to QuoteVerse

Thank you for your interest in contributing to QuoteVerse! This project is built to be beginner-friendly for Hacktoberfest 2025. Below are simple steps to get started and guidelines to follow.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch for your work: `git checkout -b feat/add-quote-yourname`.
3. Make small, focused changes. Good contributions:
   - Add or improve a quote in `data/quotes.json`.
   - Fix typos in README or docs.
   - Improve developer instructions or add tests.
4. Commit with a clear message and push your branch.
5. Open a Pull Request to `main` and follow the PR template.

## Adding a quote

- Open `data/quotes.json`.
- Add a new object to the array with the following shape:

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "text": "Your quote text here.",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "tags": ["motivation", "coding"]
}
```

- Ensure `id` is unique. Keep entries small and use proper JSON formatting.

## Running locally (summary)

- Backend (Spring Boot):
  - Use the included `mvnw` wrapper (Windows `mvnw.cmd`) or your local Maven install.
  - Typical command: `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (or `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` on Windows).
- Frontend (React):
  - `npm install` and `npm start` in the `frontend` folder.

If the project uses different folders, check the README for exact paths.
